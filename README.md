# Number_Plate_Detection
Number Plate Detection using EasyOCR   This repository contains a Python-based implementation for detecting and recognizing number plates in images using the EasyOCR library.  The project provides a streamlined approach to license plate recognition, ideal for beginners and those seeking a straightforward solution. 

Key Features: 
 
EasyOCR Integration: Leverages the powerful and user-friendly EasyOCR library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).  No need for complex model training.
 
Image Preprocessing (Optional): Includes optional image preprocessing steps (e.g., grayscale conversion, noise reduction, thresholding) to enhance OCR accuracy.  These steps can be customized based on the input image quality.
 
Bounding Box Detection (Optional):  Can be extended to include bounding box detection around the detected number plate for improved visualization and potential integration with other computer vision tasks.  (Implementation details would be included in the README)
 
Clear and Concise Code:  The code is designed for readability and ease of understanding, making it suitable for educational purposes and quick prototyping.
 
Easy Installation:  Dependencies are clearly specified in the 
requirements.txt
 file, ensuring simple and hassle-free setup.
